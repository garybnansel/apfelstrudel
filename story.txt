A hund named Jasper decided to take a tour around Germany.
Jasper got in a BMW and drove to Berlin.
He blasted Rammstein as he sped down the autobahn.
The smell of a meaty Bratwurst salivated Jaspers mouth.
Jasper then decided to mark his territory on a Porsche.  
Jasper was driving down the hauptstrasse and could smell the baeckerei.
He stopped at the baeckerei and bought some gebaech.
He sat in the klimaanlage while he ate his gebaech.
After leaving the baeckerei, Jasper went to the Biergarten.
There he met Professor Mehlhase dressed up in lederhose!
It was her birthday, so Jasper gave her his favorite brot.

He tried to lead her to a nearby schloss.
